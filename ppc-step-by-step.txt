1. Create and Access Your Google Ads Account
Sign in or create a Google Account

Use an existing Google account or create a new one specifically for your business.
Go to ads.google.com

Click Start Now and follow the prompts. If you see an option for a “Smart Campaign,” look for a small link (often at the bottom) to “Switch to Expert Mode.”
Expert Mode gives you full control and the standard interface that these steps will reference.
Set up Billing Information

Enter your business details, time zone, currency, and payment method (credit/debit card or bank account).
Your account must have valid billing to go live.
2. Define Your Campaign Goal and Strategy
Identify Campaign Objective

Common objectives: Increase website visits, generate leads (form submissions or calls), boost online sales.
Decide on Campaign Type

Search Network (text ads in Google search results) – a good starting point if you want to capture users who are actively searching for your product or service.
Other types include Display, Video (YouTube), Shopping, etc., but we’ll focus on Search for your first campaign.
3. Start Your First Campaign in Google Ads
In the Main Dashboard, click + New Campaign.
Select a goal (e.g., Website traffic or Leads).
Pick Search as the campaign type.
Enter your business website URL if asked.
Click Continue to move on to the campaign settings.
4. Configure Campaign Settings
Campaign Name: Choose something descriptive like “Web Dev Services – UK” (if that’s your focus).

Network Settings:

By default, Google will include the “Display Network” in a Search campaign. Uncheck “Include Google Display Network” unless you specifically want to run text ads on display placements. (It’s usually best to keep Search and Display separate for more control.)
Keep “Search Network” checked.
Locations:

Select the geographic regions you want to target (e.g., “United Kingdom,” or even specific regions within the UK).
If you want to exclude certain areas or countries, set up location exclusions.
Languages:

Typically English for the UK market (or multiple languages if relevant).
Budget:

Set a Daily Budget based on your monthly cap. For instance, if you want to spend £600/month, set around £20/day.
Bidding Strategy:

When just starting, you might choose “Clicks” or “Maximize Clicks” to keep it simple.
Alternatively, you can choose Manual CPC if you want more control.
“Maximize Conversions” or “Target CPA” can be powerful once you’ve set up conversion tracking (see below) and have enough data.
Ad Extensions (Optional at this stage, but recommended):

Sitelinks, Callouts, Structured Snippets, Call Extensions.
You can set them up now or after you’ve created the campaign.
Click Save and Continue to move to the next step.

5. Set Up Ad Groups
Each Ad Group contains a set of keywords and related ads. Here’s how to configure:

Ad Group Name: Make it descriptive (e.g., “Web Development – Generic Keywords”).
Keywords:
Enter your keywords (one per line, or comma-separated).
Use a mix of Exact Match ([keyword]), Phrase Match (“keyword”), and possibly Broad Match Modifier (+keyword) if you want more reach (though Google recently changed how broad match works).
Example keywords for a Web Dev service might include:
[website development company]
"web development services"
+website +design +agency
Ad Group Bid: If you’re using Manual CPC, set a default bid. This is how much you’re willing to pay per click on average. If you’re using an automated strategy like “Maximize Clicks,” you may not see this option.
Tip: Create multiple ad groups, each with a tight theme or focus. For instance, one for “website development,” one for “ecommerce development,” etc.

6. Create Your Ads
You’ll be prompted to create at least one text ad per ad group. Best practice is to create 2–3 ads per ad group to test variations.

Final URL:

Where users go after clicking your ad. This should be a relevant landing page (e.g., your Web Dev Services page).
Headlines (1, 2, 3):

Up to 30 characters each. Use them to highlight your key offer/USP.
Example: “Expert Web Development,” “Isle of Man & UK,” “Free Consultation.”
Display Path (Optional):

This is just for show, e.g., “yourdomain.com/website-dev.”
Descriptions (2):

Up to 90 characters each. You can emphasize benefits, promotions, or calls to action.
Example: “Looking for professional website development? Get a free quote today!”
Ad Strength:

Google will show a rating (e.g., “Good” or “Excellent”) – aim to improve by adding relevant keywords in your headlines/description, creating variation, etc.
7. Review and Launch Your Campaign
Double-check your campaign, ad group, keyword, and ad settings.
Click “Publish” or “Save and Continue.”
Once published, Google will review your ads (this can take a few hours or up to a day). When approved, your campaign goes live.
8. Set Up Conversion Tracking (Important!)
To measure success, you’ll want to track user actions like form fills, phone calls, or purchases. Basic steps:

In Google Ads, Tools & Settings → Measurements → Conversions.
New Conversion Action → Select Website, Phone, or App.
Follow the instructions to generate a tracking tag or code snippet.
For a website form submission, you’ll typically place a Global Site Tag on all pages of your site, and a Event Snippet on the thank-you page that appears after someone fills out a form.
If using a platform like WordPress, you can also install via a plugin or use Google Tag Manager.
Test to ensure conversions are recording properly. Once set up, you’ll see which keywords and ads drive the most leads or sales.
9. Enable Ad Extensions
Sitelinks: Link to specific pages (Portfolio, About, Pricing, Contact, etc.).
Callout Extensions: Short text highlighting your USPs (e.g., “24/7 Support,” “Award-Winning Agency,” “Over 100 Projects Completed”).
Structured Snippets: Category-based lists (e.g., “Services: Web Dev, E-Commerce, SEO, Hosting,” etc.).
Call Extension: Let users call your business directly from the search ad.
Location Extension: Show your address if relevant (can increase local credibility).
Ad Extensions improve visibility and can boost click-through rate (CTR).

10. Monitor Performance
Your campaign is live, but the work isn’t done. Frequent checks help optimize your spend:

Check Daily (at least at the start):
Ensure there are no disapprovals, technical errors, or major performance anomalies.
Look at Key Metrics:
Impressions: How often your ads are shown.
Clicks & CTR: Are people clicking your ads? A CTR above ~2% for a targeted campaign can be decent, but it varies by industry.
Cost-Per-Click (CPC): Is it within your budget?
Conversions & Cost-Per-Conversion: Are you generating leads at a profitable rate?
11. Optimize & Refine
Keyword Adjustments:

Pause or reduce bids on keywords with high spend but low conversions.
Identify new keywords from the Search Terms report. Add any irrelevant terms as Negative Keywords.
Ad Testing:

Compare which ad variations yield better CTR and conversions.
Keep top performers, revise or remove low performers.
Landing Page Improvements:

Make sure your landing page is relevant, loads quickly, and has a clear call-to-action.
Tools like Google Analytics or heatmapping tools can help you see user behavior.
Adjust Bidding Strategy:

If you have enough conversion data (usually 15–30 conversions in 30 days), consider switching to Target CPA or “Maximize Conversions” to let Google optimize bids automatically.
12. Scale Your Success
Once your first campaign is profitable and stable:

Increase Budget Gradually:

If your campaign is delivering a positive ROI, increasing your daily budget can drive more leads.
Expand Keywords / Campaigns:

Test new ad groups or campaign types (Display, YouTube) to reach new audiences.
Leverage Remarketing:

Show ads to people who already visited your site but didn’t convert.
Try Other Ad Formats:

Responsive Search Ads: Let Google dynamically combine headlines and descriptions to find the best-performing combination.
Summary
Launching your first Google Ads campaign involves careful planning, setting up the right targeting, creating compelling ads, and continually tracking and optimizing. Start with a Search Campaign in Expert Mode, choose relevant keywords, write clear ad copy, and set up conversion tracking to measure what matters most—real leads or sales.

Once you follow these steps and go live, monitor your campaign closely, fine-tune your keywords, and iterate on your ads and landing pages. Over time, your data will guide you on where to allocate budget and how to improve your campaign’s performance. Good luck with your first Google Ads adventure!
